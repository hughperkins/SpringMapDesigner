  same name as assembly, minus extension, with instance method "Load"

Release 0.3d (3rd December 2006):
- changed xscale and yscale from 1 to 8.  This corrects the map area.
- Whakamatunga_Riri.sm3 can now be loaded from inside any directory called "Maps", even if the directory is not a direct subdirectory of MapDesigner
- added try...catch around mainloop; should silently catch most exceptions, log to console, then continue
- default texture is white
- Add Texture Stage will create a new texture stage of type "Blend"
- It's no longer possible to remove all texture stages
- Errors reading numbers from config.xml will now generate warning messages rather than crashing MapDesigner
- Locale forced to en-gb, so floats in the config.xml will need a decimal separator of ".", rather than changing from country to country

- crashdump added
- issue with editing height near East or South side of map corrected
